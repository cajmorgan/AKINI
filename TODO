1. Server folder opinionated structure with watch (nodemon similar) to target server.js file. 
2. Rebuild system, 
where build only happens for specific page if a file has a newer change date of the build file.
This will improve performance a lot on larger projects and be more similar to make. 
Only rebuild when in need.
